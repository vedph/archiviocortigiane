# Reshaping the figure of the Courtesan in a digital archive: a feminist case study on Veronica Franco
# A prototype

This repository contains the documentation regarding the prototype realised for my MA's Degree dissertation in Digital &amp; Public Humanities. 

# The aim

The research question undertaken regards the condition of Venetian courtesans in the 16th century and it is here presented as a case study. 
In particular, the research focuses on archival documents concerning Veronica Franco (1546-1591). Through the figure of this <i>cortigiana onesta</i> and poetess, this work aims to shed light on the identity of a subordinate class. 
The interdisciplinary, intersectional and feminist approach of the research seeks to dismantle a deep and secular historiographical prejudice by giving space to those women who, even if victims of structural discrimination in Venetian society, were able to defend themselves and fight back, as in the case of Veronica Franco. 


# Venetian 16th-century courtesans & Veronica Franco




# The selected archival materials


The documents selected for the realisation of the prototype are thus of different nature, both archival and bibliographical. The research and collection of the archival materials took place in <i>Archivio di Stato di Venezia (ASV)</i>, and it concerns the selection of essential documents regarding Venetian 16th-century courtesans, Veronica Franco in particular: a deliberazione of 1543 enacted by the Senate and by <i>Provveditori sopra le Pompe</i>, regarding the luxury of courtesans and their clothing; Veronica Franco’s first <i>testamento</i>of 1564; and Veronica Franco’s <i>processo</i> of 1580, in which she was accused of witchcraft. The facsimiles, and thus the digitisation, and the transcriptions of the <i>delibera</i>, <i>testamento</i> and <i>processo</i> will be present in the prototype.
